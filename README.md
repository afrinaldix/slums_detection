# Slum Mapping
### Slums mapping from pretrained CNN network on VHR and MR imagery 

This repository is aimed to provide step by step methodology from creation of dataset to classifying slums through transfer learning.
Slums detection in cities of major developing nations has been experimented with different methods and techniques. Majority of which are difficult to reiterate and follow to implement in different cities. While Very High Resolution datasets have primarily been used for such tasks, some studies have also worked with Medium Resolution datasets in Slum detection and mapping. This study utilised both VHR and MR datasets and compared the results. We demonstrate a simple step by step approach to map slums. Similar procedure can be followed for slum or any landform detection in any city.

#### The Methodology consists of primarily four subtasks. 
> - Creation of Training dataset using Google Earth Platform.
> - Generation of transfer Values from Inception Network.
> - Creation of Simple Neural Network to classify the inputs.
> - Mapping the outputs and evaluation of the Model.
